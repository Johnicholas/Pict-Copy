Pict installation instructions
------------------------------

TO INSTALL PICT...

*) Untar the Pict sources using a command like "tar xvf pict-N.NN.tar"
   or (if they are still compressed) "zcat pict-N.NN.tar.Z | tar xvf -".
   This will create a directory named "pict".  (Since you are reading this
   file, this step is probably already finished.)

*) Install the Gnu C Compiler and Gnu Make utility, if it they are not
   already installed on your system.  The rest of these instructions
   assume that gnu make is named "gmake" on your system.

   The current versions of Gnu software are available by anonymous FTP
   from internet host prep.ai.mit.edu in the directory pub/gnu.  (Many
   other internet sites carry mirrors of the GNU archive.)

   If you see errors from gmake while building Pict, you may want to check
   that your version of gmake is up to date by typing "gmake --version".
   Pict should compile under all versions later than 3.67.

*) Edit the file SiteSpecific to give appropriate values to the 
   variables INSTALLDIR and INSTALLLIB.  These should be the only 
   variables you need to set.

   To install Pict in your own home directory, set INSTALLDIR and 
   INSTALLLIB to values like this:
        INSTALLDIR = $(HOME)/bin
        INSTALLLIB = $(HOME)/lib/pict

*) Now type "gmake install" to build Pict.  (You may need to become root
   if INSTALLDIR and INSTALLLIB are not in your personal filespace.)

   N.b.  Pict is written to be highly portable.  However, it has only
   been ported to a small number of environments so far.  There may
   very well be trouble with makefiles, search paths, include paths,
   shared libraries, missing utilities, etc. at this point in the
   installation procedure.

   If you have trouble at this step, try typing "gmake verbose", which
   will print a more detailed trace of exactly which arguments are being
   passed to gcc, etc.  

   Some notes about building Pict on specific machine architectures appear 
   at the bottom of this file.

*) Once Pict is built, you can test it by typing "gmake examples".
   This will build executable files for several programs in the
   Examples directory.

   To see some demos written in Pict, type "gmake demo".

*) You may now want to add INSTALLDIR to your standard search path.  
   There is no need to add INSTALLLIB.


If you have any trouble building Pict, please let us know.  In
particular, if you have trouble *and* succeed in resolving it, we will
be most grateful to hear about what you had to change.

ARCHITECTURE-SPECIFIC NOTES

Pict has been compiled successfully on these platforms:
   - Sun Sparc   (SunOS and Solaris)
   - 486/586     (Linux)
   - DEC Alpha   (Ultrix)

Architectures where problems have been encountered in the past:
   - SGI

Pict does not currently run on Windows or Macintosh systems.
Preliminary experiments indicate that a Windows port would not be too
difficult.
